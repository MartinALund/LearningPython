## Caesar cipher
10/02/2018 

Project made with a friend who is currently studying to get a bachelors degree in IT security.

The Caesar cipher is an algorithm in which you can encrypt/decrypt a string.
If you encrypt the string 'abc' with a key of 1 it will return 'bcd', so it shifts 1 space upwards in the alphabet.
